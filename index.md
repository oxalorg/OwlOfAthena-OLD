Athena (/əˈθiːnə/; Attic Greek: Ἀθηνᾶ, Athēnā, or Ἀθηναία,
Athēnaia; Epic: Ἀθηναίη, Athēnaiē; Doric: Ἀθάνα, Athānā)
or Athene (/əˈθiːniː/; Ionic: Ἀθήνη, Athēnē), often given
the epithet Pallas (/ˈpæləs/; Παλλὰς), is the goddess of
wisdom, courage, inspiration, civilization, law and justice,
mathematics, strength, war strategy, the arts, crafts, and
skill in ancient Greek religion and mythology. Minerva is
the Roman goddess identified with Athena.[2] Athena is known
for her calm temperament, as she moves slowly to anger. She
is noted to have only fought for just reasons, and would not
fight without a purpose.[3]

Athena is portrayed as an astute companion of heroes and is
the patron goddess of heroic endeavour. She is the virgin
patroness of Athens. The Athenians founded the Parthenon on
the Acropolis of her namesake city, Athens (Athena Parthenos),
in her honour.[2]

Veneration of Athena was so persistent that archaic myths
about her were recast to adapt to cultural changes.[citation
needed] In her role as a protector of the city (polis), many
people throughout the Greek world worshipped Athena as Athena
Polias (Ἀθηνᾶ Πολιάς "Athena of the city"). While the city of
Athens and the goddess Athena essentially bear the same name
(Athena the goddess, Athenai the city), it is not known which
of the two words is derived from the other.[4
