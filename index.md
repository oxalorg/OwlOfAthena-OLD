In poetry from Homer, an oral tradition of the 8th or 7th
century BC, onward, Athena's most common epithet is Glaukopis
(γλαυκῶπις), which usually is translated as, bright-eyed or
with gleaming eyes. 

The word is a combination of glaukos
(γλαυκός, meaning gleaming, silvery, and later, bluish-green
or gray) and ops (ὤψ, eye, or sometimes, face). It is
interesting to note that glaux (γλαύξ, "little owl")
is from the same root, presumably according to some, because
of the bird's own distinctive eyes. The bird which sees well
in the night is closely associated with the goddess of wisdom:
in archaic images, Athena is frequently depicted with an owl
(or "owl of Athena" and later under the Roman Empire, "owl
of Minerva") perched on her hand. This pairing evolved in
tandem so that even today the owl is a symbol of perspicacity
and erudition. 

Unsurprisingly, the owl became a sort of
Athenian mascot. The olive tree is likewise sacred to her.
In earlier times, Athena may well have been a bird goddess,
similar to the unknown goddess depicted with owls, wings, and
bird talons on the Burney relief, a Mesopotamian terracotta
relief of the early second millennium BC.
